# CurrencyConverter
Scrapes poe.trade for exchange rates for currency orbs and tells you how much of that currency you have in chaos.

Things to add:
    *DONE* add a quick code for editing quickly so that the whole name isn't necessary to just edit one currency (ex for exlated orb or mcs for master cartographer's sextant)
    *DONE* ability to edit how many of a currency you have //needs to check for bad input
    *DONE* store ratios and inventory as well as load this data on startup
    *DONE* check if a webpage doesn't have at least 5 listings, this affects things like mirrors and perandus coins
    check if currencies are listed backwards(72 ex for 1 chaos instead of 1 ex for 72 chaos, doesn't happen often but is frequent enough)
