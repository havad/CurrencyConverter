# CurrencyConverter
Scrapes poe.trade for exchange rates for currency orbs and tells you how much of that currency you have in chaos.

Things to add:
    check if currencies are listed backwards(72 ex for 1 chaos instead of 1 ex for 72 chaos, doesn't happen often but is frequent enough)
    be able to choose which league (this probably entails changing the storage text files or just having one per league)
        *DONE* fix load and save data files to take parameters
        add an option to switch leagues without restarting program //last thing i think is fixing all the urls when a league switches
        *DONE*should probably make a league object
