# CurrencyConverter
Scrapes poe.trade for exchange rates for currency orbs and tells you how much of that currency you have in chaos.

Things to add:
    ability to edit how many of a currency you have
    store ratios and inventory as well as load this data on startup
    check if a webpage doesn't have at least 5 listings, this affects things like mirrors and perandus coins
    check if currencies are listed backwards(72 ex for 1 chaos instead of 1 ex for 72 chaos, doesn't happen often but is frequent enough)
